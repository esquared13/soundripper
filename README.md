take the audio out of the video
The goal of this project is to create a utility that can download YouTube videos and convert them into an mp3 file.  There are a lot of 3rd party services that can handle this through a web browser, but sometimes these sites have some uncertainty around security.  This utility removes the uncertainty and puts all of the downloading and conversion on the client side in a desktop application using Windows Forms .NET CORE.
